# 👋 Hi there! I'm Anna, a passionate MLOps Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm on a mission to bridge the gap between Machine Learning and DevOps by building scalable, reliable, and automated ML systems. 🚀

### 🔍 What I'm Focused On
- 🛠️ ML Model Deployment: Streamlining the journey from Jupyter notebooks to production-ready systems.
- 🔄 CI/CD Pipelines: Automating ML workflows with tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and Airflow.
- ☁️ Infrastructure as Code: Leveraging Terraform and AWS CloudFormation for reproducible environments.
- 📊 ML Monitoring: Implementing robust solutions for model performance tracking with Prometheus and Grafana.
- 🤝 Collaboration: Bridging the gap between data scientists, engineers, and DevOps teams.
